The data set that I’m using is the monthly price index for various products throughout Canada during July 2020 to Novemebr 2020. This is based on consumer expenditure basket weights, and covers the majority of consumer goods and services. This helps give an idea of expenditures during the pandemic and physical distancing, which clearly shows the impact of COVID-19. The changes in the price index help access the price changes correlated with the cost of living. I have chosen this data set because it is a topic that concerns each and every individual. We are all living in a pandemic, and have no idea when it will be over. All of us have been impacted by COVID-19, whether you got this virus, know someone who did, or had a difficult time switching to online, or are struggling with their mental health. A lot of people are financially unstable due to the loss of their jobs, and have had a difficult time providing for their families. That is why I chose this data to see how fluctuated the price index has been, to see how much the pandemic has impacted people. I can see which products are more necessary than others.
